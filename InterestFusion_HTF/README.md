InterestFusion: Combat loneliness in education by connecting individuals based on shared interests. Secure profiles, matching, and future plans for scalability and enhanced safety


InterestFusion is a platform aimed at addressing mental health issues such as loneliness, alienation, and social awkwardness within education institutions. By connecting individuals based on shared interests and hobbies, we aim to foster meaningful relationships and combat feelings of isolation.

## Project Details

### Current Situation
- Designed for a class of fewer than 100 people initially
- Users can create, update, and delete their profiles
- Profiles are authenticated by favourite technique
- Users can view and match with others based on similar interests/hobbies
- User verification is done via OTP, potentially using the Vonage API
- Connected users can contact each other using SSN

### Future Plans
- Scale platform to support larger databases and user populations
- Improve stability and user experience
- Implement features for blocking/hiding matches and reporting users
- Enable monitored and safe chat functionality between connected individuals
- Optimizing the matching algorithm using tree data structure for matching the tags used in the profile

## Unique Selling Points (USPs)
- Minimalistic user data collection, ensuring privacy
- Profile information is only shared after confirmation from both users
- Users receive notifications of matching interests, but details are shared only upon mutual agreement
- No cheesey or overthought answers required
- Emphasis on user privacy and data security
- Notifications facilitate mutual consent before sharing profile information
